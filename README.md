#Problem Statement 

In the indoor environment air temperature and humidity is not constant.
The presence of kitchen, washrooms and appliances like microwave oven and refrigerator will influence indoor temperature and humidity.
Such variation will lead to adverse impact on the residentsâ€™ health. So there is a need to constantly monitor temperature and humidity and alert the residents to act appropriately.

#Proposed Solution 

An IoT based temperature and humidity based system will find market in many homes.
Now a days the residents tend to spend indoors during much of the day.
A temperature and humidity measurement system will alert the residents to take correct action by controlling them.
